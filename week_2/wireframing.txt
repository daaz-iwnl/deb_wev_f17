First off, it has to be said that the article is incredibly basic, and there are few times when the
information presented is specifically for UX or wireframing. We could easily be talking about designing
buildings and switch a few words around, or talking about how to analyze an article. This is more like
an article on how to problem solve, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. However, perhaps the author should
have broken down the "Workflows and Sketches" section, since it is the both the most UX/wireframing-specific
but also the least intuitive/common sense issue. Certain topics like working with others and understanding
the problem are applicable to every design/problem solving situation, and most people will for that reason
have heard the same thing more than enough times. In this case, it would be better if they were understood
in the context of the workflow and the sketching in some way that contributes specifically to the unique
problems of user experience.
