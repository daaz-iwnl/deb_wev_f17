                	<h3>Making the pastry</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Place flour in a large bowl - create a well in the center with your fingers, and fill with vegetable oil, egg whites, salt, and lemon juice.</li>
						<li>Mix with fingers until just combined, and sprinkle with water.</li>
						<li>Knead until a sticky dough forms.  Turn out onto a lightly floured tabletop, and knead rigorously (slap onto the table about 100 times), until the dough is soft and supple.</li>
						<li>Place in a lightly oiled bowl and let rest for 30 minutes.</li>
						<li>Combine apples, sugar, lemon zest, raisins, and cinnamon.  Set aside and let liquid weep from apples.</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Making the filling</h3>
					<ol>
					<li>Cover a large table with a cotton tablecloth, and liberally dust with flour.</li>
					<li>Roll out dough on tablecloth until about 24" in diameter, and using floured fists, stretch dough out as large as possible without tearing.</li>
					<li>Back on the tablecloth, gently tug at edges of dough until it's a rectangle thin enough to see the pattern of the tablecloth underneath.</li>
					<li>Trim off torn/thick edges.</li>
					<li>Drizzle with melted butter, and brush until evenly coated.  Sprinkle with chopped nuts.</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Putting it Together</h3>
					<ol>				
					<li>Place about 3/4 of apple mixture on one side of the dough rectangle, and using the tablecloth, roll the apples over onto the dough square.</li>
					<li>Brush the newly-exposed dough covering the apples with melted butter.</li>
					<li>Roll apples over again, and repeat, until apples are at the center of a long, closed roll.</li>
					<li>Pinch ends together to seal contents inside, and place seam-side down on a parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
					<li>Brush liberally with a beaten egg.</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Baking</h3>
					<ol>					
					<li>Bake for about an hour, basting with melted butter every 10-15 minutes, as soon as the crust begins to look dry.</li>
					<li>Remove from oven when golden brown.  Allow to cool at least one hour before slicing, dusting with powdered sugar, and serving.</li>
					<li>In a small bowl, combine cream and sugar.  Beat to stiff peaks, and pipe into a bowl, served alongside strudel.</li>
					</ol>
