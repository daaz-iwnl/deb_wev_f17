			<p class="alpha long lgr">hello. hi. thanks for being here.  i'm daniel and this is a site about me and the work that i do. if you've stumbled here, then chances are you saw and liked what i got</p>
			<p class="long lgr">i am first and foremost a video editor and designer. while i'm mostly interested by the viscerally stimulating, i also like traditional art and math and science, especially physics, and when they intermingle into a unified whole.</p>
			<p class="long lgr">my deal is that i like weird, niche stuff. if u ask me to make a design, i'll probably want to put on a guitar or something because i like to build guitars.</p>
			<p class="long lgr linklessInSeattle">whatever it is, you can reach me at <a href="mailto:dyhl@nyu.edu" target="_top">dyhl@nyu.edu</a> or you can download my resume <a href="resume.pdf" download>here</a>.</p>
